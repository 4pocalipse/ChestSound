# ChestSound
This mod recreates the chest sound behavior from version b1.8 (door sounds) on b1.7.3.

## Compatibility
The `e` and `hp` classes are modified by this mod. If other installed mods also modifies any of these classes, the mods will conflict.
Since this mod consists of only two lines of code, you can try to port them to your mod, if there's any class conflict. The modified lines are marked in the source code with a comment.

## Installing
1. Drag the contents of `/bin/ChestSounds.zip` on your `minecraft.jar`.
2. Delete the `META-INF` directory.
